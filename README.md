As a photographer, I wanted to find a way to display my photos in a way they could be quickly digested.  I got a great idea from the article [Adaptive Photo Layout with Flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/adaptive-photo-layout-with-flexbox/) by [Tim Van Damme](https://css-tricks.com/author/timvandamme/).

As I started the project, it continued to build in my mind and I decided I wanted to build it on a ReactJS framework, and then try to see if I could add some additional practice in loading photos in a more efficient way.

### Project demonstrates the following:
---

- [x] <em>User Story 1: </em> As a photography website, ALL photos should be the authors.  This project demonstrates not only my own photography skills, but use of color, light, form, line, and subjects to tell a story.
- [x] <em>User Story 2: </em> As a photographer, ALL photos should use a industry level POST production process.  This project demonstrates my ability to use Adobe PhotoShop, LightRoom, and Bridge.
- [x] <em>User Story 3: </em> As a web designer, the website should demonstrate responsive design on mobile, tablet, and desktop.  This project demonstrates my ability to use Flex-Box, CSS, and media queries to achieve truly responsive web design which displays in mobile, tablet, or desktop form equally as well. 
- [x] <em>User Story 4: </em> As a content heavy website, this website should minimize load times.  This project demonstrates my ability to use the Intersection Observer to achieve lazy-loading.
